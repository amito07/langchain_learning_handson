The Quiet Algorithm

In a room of silent light,
Where numbers breathe without a sound,
A restless mind begins its flight
Across the data, vast and unbound.

Not with ink, nor brush, nor flame,
But tensors shaped in hidden space,
It learns the patterns, names the name,
And finds the signal in the trace.

A whisper fed through layers deep,
Weights adjust in patient grace,
Errors fall like drifting sleep,
Gradients guide their soft embrace.

From scattered points it starts to see—
A curve, a face, a voice, a sign.
What once was noise turns clarity;
What once was chaos, now design.

It does not dream, yet seems to know,
Predicting futures yet unseen.
From loss it learns, from trials it grows,
A silent, ever-curious machine.

But still behind the coded art
A human spark ignites the flame—
For every model has a heart
That beats within its maker’s aim.

And so in loops of hope and fear,
Through epochs long and datasets wide,
We teach the tools we engineer—
And watch them learn what we confide.
